# Assignment 1 Postmortem

## What's your past experience with front-end development?

I have done a group assignment in another class where my work was focusing on
the front-end of the project. I have also done a few projects on the side where
I helped with the front-end development.

## How difficult was this assignment?

Not very difficult. It felt typical for an introduction assignment for any
programming course.

## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

Yes I did! I learned a bit about CSS, which I have never used before.

## How could this assignment be improved?

Maybe you could have the students add a little more to the assignment
themselves. You could give a brief introduction to a few other tools. 

## Any other comments?
